Toward a future free of America

<p>Welccome to the Currently Official Webpage of the Minnesota Liberation Front (MNLF), a left-wing movement. Our principal is simple: Minnesota would be best off going seperate ways with the rest of the United States. Unfortunatley, the organization is not operational (yet!), so there is not much here. If you are here, you are likely here for the Queer Index, A project hosted with the intention of being used in collaboration with a local queer organization.</p>

If you want to help in starting up the organisation, contact thenegativespace3m@gmail.com, subject "Minnesota Liberation", and we can begin.
